# BEANS
*Basic Educational Assembly with Neat Syntax*

## What is this?
Well, BEANS is a custom programming language trying to look and feel similar to basic assembly. It emulates ram and registers. How would you display the information? Well weve got a flexible IO api that gives you the power to create IO modules using python and directly import them into your code.

## How can i run code?
*Using the project is the best way to utilize the project*

Curently, to run code youll need both uv and git installed. Then youll want to clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/BravestCheetah/BEANS`

Then you can just run any code file by navigating inside the repo and run this command:

`uv run exec.py path/to/code`

**NOTE: This will change in the future, exec.py is a temporary program to allow the user to execute code until the cli gets implemented**

## How do i write code?
*Using the project is the best way to utilize the project*

We have documentation about the developement process and coding syntax as well as examples availble [here](https://github.com/BravestCheetah/BEANS/tree/main/docs/development.md)

## How do i contribute?
*Contribution is the first step towards freindship, if your code isnt shit*

To contribute follow these steps:

* Review the entire codebase (its not that much code, just read through it so you understand what the stuff does)
* make you changes
* Give an informational commit message (not just "." or "commit")
* Create a PR containing all your commits on github
* Wait for a developer to review and approve your changes
* If given, apply changes mentioned by reviewers and create a new PR
